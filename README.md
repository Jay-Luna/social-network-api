## Description

This project sets up the api part of a social networking application in which users can share their thoughts, react to their friends's thoughts and create a friend list. I was able to use Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose ODM as schema-based solution to model my application data.

## Installation

To add seed data, run

``` npm run seed ```

To run application locally, run

```npm run start``` or ```node server.js```
